bugs
	known
		path not opening in MacOS, like /bin
	fixed
		open_url is evidently a poorly documented but built-in sublime command, so this is overriding some default sublime features like pulling up the Documentation from the help menu
	
improvement ideas
	backlog
		bug: open_url is a registered command, need to find another command name
		scan to see if cursor is inside quotes to a path that exists, "c:\temp\folder w space\file w space.txt" opens		
		look in project for matching file name (relative path not required), needs sublime text 3, http://www.sublimetext.com/blog/articles/sublime-text-3-beta
		add run with, lets user pick an app to run a file with instead of just the shell
		Open multipe items with a return or carrage return like these:
			http://google.com
			gmail.com
			http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funky_Cold_Medina
		aliases
			[myfile] somewhere in the file # Open this [myfile] = c:\asdasdasd
	implemented
		setting to always run or always edit certain files
			"endswith", ".sublime-project", "run"
			"endswith", ".sln", "run"
			"endswith", ".txt", "edit"

code snippets for debugging
