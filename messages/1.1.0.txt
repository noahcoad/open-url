Open URL has a maintainer! @noahcoad is letting me continue development on the awesome Open URL plugin. In the last few weeks I've added a lot of new features.

I'll also work to handle outstanding issues and merge pull requests, if they haven't been addressed by features that were added.

Support for Sublime Text 2 has officially been dropped, which I hope will affect precisely none of you.

Instead of trying to summarize the new stuff I just pasted the relevant parts of the README.

Thanks and happy coding!
