# 2.6.0

## Path transform settings

Open URL just got a whole lot more powerful!

This release adds the following path transform settings: `aliases`, `search_paths`, `file_prefixes`, `file_suffixes`, based on these issues:

- https://github.com/noahcoad/open-url/issues/49
- https://github.com/noahcoad/open-url/issues/50

These settings let you apply a combination of transformations to the file/folder path and try to open each of them. This lets you do things like this:

```
"search_paths": ["src"],
"file_suffixes": [".js"],
```

Open URL can now open a file at `src/utils/module.js` with this path: `utils/module`. Very nice for absolute imports and languages with modules!

Check out <https://github.com/noahcoad/open-url/blob/master/open_url.sublime-settings> for examples on how to use the new settings.
