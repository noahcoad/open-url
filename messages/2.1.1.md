# 2.1.1

## Big News

Open URL has another maintainer! @noahcoad is letting me continue development on the awesome Open URL plugin. In the last few months I've added a lot of new features.

I'll also work to handle outstanding issues and merge pull requests, if they haven't been addressed by features that were added.

Support for Sublime Text 2 has officially been dropped, which I hope will affect precisely none of you.

Instead of trying to summarize the new stuff just have a look at the README: https://github.com/noahcoad/open-url

Thanks and happy coding!
