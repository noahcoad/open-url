# New Feature
The `cwd` kwarg for custom commands has special handling for two values: "project_root" and "current_file".

This lets you dynamically set the directory from which custom shell commands are executed, to either the project root or the directory of the currently open file.

Any other value for `cwd`, e.g. "/Users/myname/code/project", is unmodified. This is currently being used by the __subl: open file at line #__ command.

```
{ "label": "subl: open file at line #", "pattern": ":[0-9]+$", "commands": [ "subl" ], "kwargs": {"cwd": "project_root"} },
```

This custom command uses the [subl executable](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/command_line/command_line.html) to open a file at a specific line number, such as:

myfile.txt:21

Give it a try!
